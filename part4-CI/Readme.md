# Part 4: CI Integration
_Max time: 30 mins_

How would be integrate this test to run into CI - could you draft a **Jenkinsfile**? Or another CI pipeline that can be integrated with your Github project? 

Note: We use Jenkins as our CI tool and that’s the reason we started with Jenkinsfile, but feel free to use any other available option to integrate your project into a CI tool. 

We understand you might not be able to validate the CI pipeline, but even a draft would give us an idea over your CI understanding. 

Where you don't know the Jenkins/Groovy technical format, it’s sufficient to add a comment and explain your intention for that step
